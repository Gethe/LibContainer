# LibContainer

This is a library addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It is not designed to be run as an addon by itself, it _must be embedded_.

## Description

LibContainer is a category-based container framework for creating bag and bank AddOns.  
It takes away all the logic needed to update and create bags and slots, leaving the developer with the task of creating a layout with the design of their desires.

The framework is very extensible and is easily manipulated, has widgets for additional capabilities you'd expect to find in a container AddOn.

For more information on how to get started, see the [wiki](//github.com/p3lim-wow/LibContainer/wiki).
